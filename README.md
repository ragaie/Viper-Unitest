# This is just real demo for VIPER && UnitTest:-

## There is many another layer just for supporting demo app not compatiable with real app will need more modification

## All comuncation between layers done throw protocol.

##  Demo for currency converstion not realy focusing on business more that how things going on in VIPER




Welcome back with one of most known Structural design pattern (VIPER).

OR some people called it VIPER  Architecture, but we will discuss it later.

(Architecture & Structural design pattern).

And how write unit test for it, Demo testing Presenter and Interactor  for Home Screen.
And mocking another layer and Spy View.

we will take in details later.

This small demo for screen Just showing how things going on, It be better to learn things in small demo then you can expand them.



1- for Unit test I'm only added testing files for  (Home presenter, home  interactor) only.

So if you calculate percentage of this file, i guess it will be about 95%


2- For service manger layer it is two small to fit all cases of large application, it just small functionality for this demo

3- For Coordinator it is also to limited funcatinality for this demo, So for real life app it will need more funcationality.

4- Url data file it just way to keep all url data in one place, but can be handled with service layer with many ways else.

5- For screen to select country code

It loading code form backend and cache it for next time to load form local.

6- if user select code already added before it will remove form home.

7- home screen will update data after 30 minute.

8- also there no design pattern add to handel dependancies, it handled manual for every model, So for real app will handle it
by composstion root or Swinject or any other way.

So dependancies handling not pretty one in this task.


# I will publish templete for this demo Very SOON.
# Have good time in cheecking it.

# Thanks.
